# Generative

In this repository I collect some of my own developments that I consider generate visual content with a certain artistic touch.

## Mandelbruh
Some fractal real-time animations implemented in python.

This code is based on the PySpace (https://github.com/HackerPoet/PySpace) repository owned by HackerPoet (https://github.com/HackerPoet/). 

## Reaction-diffusion
Some generative models for reaction diffusion equations

## Collatz
Some simulations on collatz conjecture

## Primes 
Simulations on prime structures in natural numbers

## js Worlds
Pure JS joy

## Lyon
This is used to tile images into RGB symbols

## Roots
Some simulations in roots growth, used to develop some background animations for a performance.
